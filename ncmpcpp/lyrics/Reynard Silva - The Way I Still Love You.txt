Not a single day goes by
You ain′t running through my mind
I know it's over but I can′t denyI'm still missing you (I'm still missing you)
And I′m torn cause I′m hella frustrated
I know we had something special, baby
But now the fact is you're gone for good
And I don′t know what to do

I try to stay occupied
I try to put it all aside
I try and try and try and try
Still it's no use
Don′t know what's going on with me
But all I know it′s haunting me
I need your love to set me free
Listen to me

Do you still think about me baby (baby)
Cause you're on my mind and it's driving me crazy (crazy)
Are you finally over me
You can tell me the truth
Or do you still love me
The way that I still love you

Just the other day I seen you
We caught up for a little while
You told me you were doing just fine
Man, it was good to see you smile (good to see you smile)
Memories running through my head
Feelings coming back, oh yeah
And it hurts like hell
You′re happy with someone else

I try to stay occupied
I try to put it all aside
I try and try and try and try
Still it′s no use
Don't know what′s going on with me
But all I know it's haunting me
I need your love to set me free
Listen to me
Oh baby

Do you still think about me baby (baby)
Cause you′re on my mind and it's driving me crazy (crazy)
Are you finally over me
You can tell me the truth
Or do you still love me
The way that I still love you

Girl I know that I let love slip away
And I′m going insane
All because I want you back
I need you back
This is the biggest regret
I'll ever have to face, oh yeah

Do you still think about me baby (baby)
Cause you're on my mind and it′s driving me crazy (crazy)
Are you finally over me
You can tell me the truth
Or do you still love me
The way that I still love you

The way that I still love you
